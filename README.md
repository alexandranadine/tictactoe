<h1>The Odin Project: Tic-Tac-Toe</h1>
<p><b>v.1:</b></p>
<p>I am creating a tic-tac-toe game for this project. Goals of the project were as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Store gameboard info inside an array</li>
<li>Allow players to mark a specific spot on the board</li>
<li>Check for wins and draws</li>
<li>Be able to play a new game</li></ul>
<p>As of 9/20/22, this project is still in progress!! I want to add the option to play a computer.</p>
